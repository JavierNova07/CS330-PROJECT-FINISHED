# CS330-PROJECT-FINISHED
To run this project, git clone this repository in your desired location. Open cmd (on windows) from your desired location,
type python follow by the name of the one of the projects and finishing with .py. For example, python Solution.py 
Then just follow the project steps. For the first part I have an unlocking and locking code that will lock or unlock the security device,
and the second part, is just using a fixed code with the last digit being random. Is very straight forward only follow the steps of the program.
